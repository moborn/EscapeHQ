Raspberry Pi Kiosk setup instructions


Based on hardware:
Raspberry Pi 5
NOOBS Raspbian (preinstalled on SD card from PBTech kit)


1) Assemble RPi hardware and mount in case. Install heatsink on CPU and attach case fan.
2) Connect power/HDMI/keyboard/mouse
3) Initial setup wizard:
   - Country: NZ
   - Language: English
   - Timezone: Auckland
   - Use English language tickbox [yes]

4) Open the start menu, go to Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration
   - System: Change Hostname as needed
   - Interfaces: Enable SSH
   - Save and reboot
5) Open a terminal, and run:
     sudo apt-get install -y xdotool
     sudo raspi-config
6) In raspi-config, go to Advanced > A7 (Switch between X and Wayland backends), and pick W1 (X11). Close the Advanced menu, Finish config, and confirm save and reboot.
7) Changing the hostname can cause an issue with Chromium browser not opening. To fix that, open a terminal and run the command:
     rm -rf ~/.config/chromium/Singleton*
8) Open the web browser and go to https://github.com/debloper/piosk
   - Scroll to the "1.2 Installation" section, and execute the command there.
   - Then run:
     sudo reboot now
9) Once rebooted, Alt+F4 to get back to the desktop. Then run the following commands in the terminal:
     sudo nano /opt/piosk/scripts/switcher.sh
10) In the nano file editor, add this line at line 2 of the file:
     sudo xdotool mousemove 4000 4000
     exit 0
11) Press [Ctrl]+[x] to exit, press [Enter] to confirm to save changes
12) sudo nano /opt/piosk/scripts/runner.sh
     - delete the line "--enable-low-end-device-mode \"
     - below '--no-first-run \', add '--autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required \'
     sudo reboot now
13) When rebooting, before the browser automatically opens, the Raspberry Pi's IP will display in the top right. Take note of that, then from a different computer/device on the network, browse to that IP address, e.g. 192.168.178.143
14) Click the x's next to all the URLs showing in the list, then add the Houdini URL for the display at the top and click 'Add' then 'Apply'.
