TO ADD SOUND TO ROOMS (CONTROLLED BY HOUDINI)

- get the sound file you want. This should be a .mp3 file, and longer than room duration 
    (ie, longer than 1 hour. Houdini only starts the track once. 2hrs long is safe, even if its a loop)
- Add the file to: This PC->Windows(C:)->Houdini_MC->{ROOM NAME}->rooms->{ROOM NAME}->main_theme

Any additional sounds to play on houdini events will go into sounds folder, rather than main_theme folder. 
For example, the moo_exit mp3 is in the sounds folder for moo, which only plays on room completion 
rather than the 2hrs of farm sounds which plays on room start, which is in the main_theme folder

Houdini will auto update, so that the main_theme sound will play when the room is started.
