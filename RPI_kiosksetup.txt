setup pi OS as per houdini_instructions.txt. 
this was written with latest 64bit full install (not lite). (as of 19/6/25)

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get install unclutter
sudo raspi-config

System options-> Boot -> Desktop Desktop GUI
System options -> auto login -> No -> Yes
system options - audio - vc4-hdmi
interface options -> remote gpio -> yes
Advanced -> Wayland -> X11
Finish

nano run_kiosk.sh
/bin/chromium-browser  --kiosk --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars --enable-features=OverlayScrollbar https://time.is/Sydney &

ctrl +x, y, enter

sudo chmod +x run_kiosk.sh

sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

# @xscreensaver -no-splash
@xset s off
@xset s noblank
@xset -dpms
@unclutter -idle 3 -root
@/home/pi/run_kiosk.sh

ctrl +x, y, enter

sudo reboot

this should be it

sudo nano run_kiosk.sh to open and edit the webpage file

sudo apt install systemd-timesyncd
sudo nano  /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf

uncomment entire time block. NTP = time.nist.gov

ctrl+x, y, enter

sudo timedatectl set-timezone Pacific/Auckland

timedatectl checks the system time stuff. NTP should be active, time zone+time correct

on houdini:
scheduled events -> add event 
timed event, 60min left, play sound, OR load file and then select the file in rooms main theme folder

room editor-> soundtrack
delete main theme

Houdini seems to have issues loading the main theme as a soundtrack
but if you set it as an event to start with the timer it is seemingly reliable.

settings->connections
remote access needs to be turned on. The 'in room screen' link there is what to point the rasp pi at.
