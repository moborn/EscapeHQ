for manufacturing:

CAD overall
 - done in onshape, folders can't be shared with just a link - but files can.
 - folders have to be shared to specific users (i should create onshape accounts for EHQ and give permissions)

3D printing
 - .3mf files created for the print jobs, storing (I think) colours/settings etc. Created with Bambu Studio
 - I think the .3mf are bambu slicer proprietary? I'm not sure. but should store plates, colours etc
 - Printed on Bambu Lab P1S, 0.4mm nozzle with AMS V1. All prints have been PLA

Laser cutting
 - .svg files created in inkscape, following general laser cutting standard (red = cutting, black = engraving)
 - acrylic, ply, cut at UOA makerspace (trotec CO2 laser, diode lasers will not cut clear)
