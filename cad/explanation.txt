for manufacturing:

CAD overall
 - done in onshape, folders can't be shared with just a link - but files can.
 - folders have to be shared to specific users (i will create onshape accounts for EHQ and give permissions)

3D printing
 - .3mf files created for the print jobs, storing colours/settings etc. Created with Bambu Studio
 - Printed on Bambu labs P1S

Laser cutting
 - .svg files created with inkscape, following general laser cutting standard (red = cutting, black = engraving)
 - Clear acrylic cut at UOA makerspace (trotec CO2 laser, diode lasers will not cut clear)
