ROOM NAME    | PI's IP ADDRESS
Blizzard 1   | raspberrypi
Blizzard 2   | raspberrypi2
Jailbreak    | jailbreak
Moo          | raspberrypi4
Backstage    | darkside-switch | darkside-chords | darkside-guitar
jail siren/office door | jail-siren
backstage screen | backstage-screen
jail screen | jail-screen


THE PASSWORD FOR ALL RASPBERRY PI'S IS: ehqtech@p7#

To connnect, run the following in a terminal:
    ssh pi@{ip address}

Then input password

For all except backstage, may have to create 2 terminals - first will succeed in auto running python script, 
second will fail to connect - and then you can actually access pi. 
Not sure why this is, but opening a second terminal seemed to work for me.
It also doesn't happen all the time, annoyingly

USEFUL PI TERMINAL COMMANDS

Create Folder | mkdir {folder name}
Enter Folder | cd {folder name}
Exit Folder | cd
View Contents of Folder | ls
Write File | scp {full path to file on local computer} pi@{piâ€™s ip address}:/home/pi/Scripts
Run Script | {filename}.py
Copy File From Pi to Computer (this will copy to the root directory the terminal is in) | scp pi@{name}:/home/pi/{local path} .
View Code | vim {filename}.py
Check status of houdini autorun | sudo systemctl status houdini.service

Components that are dependent on computer ip address (ie, if the computer changes, these need to be changed): 
exitSoundService.py (both blizzards, moo) - playing the respective exit sound
jailscreen - displaying room screen
